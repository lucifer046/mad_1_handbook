# Deployment and DevOps

## What is Deployment?

You've been coding on your laptop. Your app runs perfectly. But it only runs for YOU, on YOUR machine.

**Deployment** is the process of putting your app onto a server that is connected to the internet, so that **anyone in the world** can use it.

```
  YOUR LAPTOP                INTERNET               PRODUCTION SERVER
  ┌──────────┐                                       ┌──────────────────┐

  (Only you)                                         └──────────────────┘

## The Three Cloud Service Models

Think of building in the cloud like renting a kitchen:

```
  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │                    WHAT YOU MANAGE vs. WHAT THEY MANAGE          │
  ├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │                                                                  │
  │  IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)                             │
  │  "Renting a raw plot of land"                                   │
  │  You get: a computer (virtual machine) connected to internet     │
  │  You manage: OS, Python, Flask, database — EVERYTHING            │
  │  Examples: AWS EC2, DigitalOcean Droplets, Google Compute        │
  │                                                                  │
  │  PaaS (Platform as a Service)                                   │
  │  "Renting a fully-equipped kitchen"                              │
  │  You get: a platform that already has Python installed           │
  │  You manage: Just your app code                                  │
  │  Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine, Railway, Render            │
  │                                                                  │
  │  SaaS (Software as a Service)                                   │
  │  "Ordering food from a restaurant"                               │
  │  You get: a complete, ready-to-use product                       │
  │  You manage: Nothing technical                                   │
  │  Examples: Gmail, Google Docs, Trello, Salesforce                │
  │                                                                  │
  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## CI/CD: Automating the Entire Pipeline

**Without CI/CD:**
```
Developer finishes code
  ↓
Manually runs tests (maybe forgets?)
  ↓
Manually builds the app
  ↓
Manually copies files to server
  ↓
Manual configuration on server
  ↓
App is live (maybe... hopefully)
```

**With CI/CD (the professional way):**
```
Developer pushes code to GitHub
  ↓
GitHub Actions automatically runs ALL tests   ← CI (Continuous Integration)
  ↓
If ALL tests pass...
  ↓
Automatically builds and deploys to server    ← CD (Continuous Deployment)
  ↓
App is live ✓ (automatically, every time)
```

### A Real GitHub Actions Workflow File

This is the YAML file that automates everything:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Test and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]       # Trigger this when code is pushed to main branch

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest   # Run on a fresh Linux machine

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2        # Step 1: Download your code
      
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt   # Step 2: Install packages
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest                            # Step 3: Run all tests!
      
      # If tests fail, everything STOPS HERE. No broken code gets deployed.
      
      - name: Deploy to server
        run: |
          # Step 4: If we reach here, all tests passed. Deploy!
          echo "Deploying to production..."
```

## Docker: "It Works on MY Machine" — Problem Solved

The most common phrase in software development is:

> **"But it works on MY machine!"**

This happens because your laptop has Python 3.11, your teammate has Python 3.8, and the server has Python 3.6. Different versions, different behaviors!

**Docker** solves this by bundling your entire app AND its environment into a single **container** — like a shipping container that carries everything needed.

```
  WITHOUT DOCKER:             WITH DOCKER:
  
  Your laptop:                Docker Container:
  Python 3.11                 ┌─────────────────────────┐
  Flask 2.0                   │  Python 3.11 (fixed)    │
  Works!                      │  Flask 2.0   (fixed)    │
                              │  Your app.py (fixed)    │
  Your teammate's laptop:     └─────────────────────────┘
  Python 3.8                        ↓         ↓         ↓
  Flask 1.5                  Laptop  Teammate  Server
  Broken!                    All identical. All work!
  
  Production server:
  Python 3.6
  Really broken!
```

### A Dockerfile Example

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile — The "recipe" for building your Docker image

# Step 1: Start from an official Python image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Step 2: Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy your requirements file and install packages
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 4: Copy all your app files into the container
COPY . .

# Step 5: Tell Docker how to RUN your app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

```bash
# Build the image from your Dockerfile
docker build -t my-flask-app .

# Run your container (your app is now live on port 5000)
docker run -p 5000:5000 my-flask-app
```

## Logging: Your App's "Black Box Recorder"

An airplane has a "black box" that records everything. Your app needs logging for the same reason — to understand what went wrong when something crashes.

```
  2026-04-19 10:32:01 INFO  → User alice logged in
  2026-04-19 10:32:15 INFO  → GET /students - 200 OK (45ms)
  2026-04-19 10:32:20 WARNING → Database query took 3.2 seconds (slow!)
  2026-04-19 10:32:45 ERROR → Unhandled exception in /checkout
  2026-04-19 10:32:45 ERROR → ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
  2026-04-19 10:32:45 ERROR → File "app.py", line 87, in calculate_total
```

```python
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,            # Log INFO and above (not DEBUG)
    format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s → %(message)s',
    filename='app.log'             # Save to a file
)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username = request.form.get('username')
    
    logger.info(f"Login attempt for user: {username}")
    
    if authenticate(username, request.form.get('password')):
        logger.info(f"Login SUCCESS for user: {username}")
        return redirect('/dashboard')
    else:
        logger.warning(f"Login FAILED for user: {username}")
        return "Invalid credentials", 401
```

### Log Levels (From Least to Most Severe)

```
  DEBUG    → Very detailed. "I'm about to run this query..."
  INFO     → Normal events. "User logged in."
  WARNING  → Something unexpected but not breaking. "Slow query!"
  ERROR    → Something broke. "Exception occurred."
  CRITICAL → The app itself is in trouble. "Cannot connect to database!"
```

[WARNING]
**Log Rotation**: Without it, your log files grow forever and eventually fill up the entire server disk. Use Python's `RotatingFileHandler` to automatically archive old logs:
```python
from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler
handler = RotatingFileHandler('app.log', maxBytes=10*1024*1024, backupCount=5)
# Max 10MB per file, keep last 5 files
```
[/CALLOUT]

## The Deployment Checklist

Before you deploy anything to production:

```
  Security:
  [ ] Never hardcode passwords or API keys in code
  [ ] Set DEBUG=False in production
  [ ] Use HTTPS (SSL certificate)
  
  Performance:
  [ ] Test with realistic load (not just 1 user)
  [ ] Set up database indexes on frequently searched columns
  [ ] Enable caching for slow, repeated queries
  
  Reliability:
  [ ] Set up logging and monitoring
  [ ] Configure log rotation
  [ ] Set up alerts for when the app crashes
  
  Process:
  [ ] All tests pass
  [ ] Code has been reviewed by another person
  [ ] You can ROLL BACK (undo) if something goes wrong
```
